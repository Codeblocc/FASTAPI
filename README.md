# 3rd May
- Schema Validation with Pydantic -> imported the Pydantic module and BaseModel class
- CRUD Operations

- Storing in Array -> tested out the get and create posts on Postman -> imported the random module with randrange variable.
- Gave each posts an ID. randrange was used for a random ID to be applied to create posts.
- Still learning at every step.
